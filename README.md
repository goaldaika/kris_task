The program is made and satify below criteria: 
A program that synchronizes two folders: source and replica. The program should maintain a full, identical copy of source folder at replica folder.
_Synchronization must be one-way: after the synchronization content of the replica folder should be modified to exactly match content of the source folder;
_Synchronization should be performed periodically. File creation/copying/removal operations should be logged to a file and to the console output;
_Folder paths, synchronization interval and log file path should be provided using the command line arguments;
_It is undesirable to use third-party libraries that implement folder synchronization;
_It is allowed (and recommended) to use external libraries implementing other well-known algorithms. For example, there is no point in implementing yet another function that calculates MD5 if you need it for the task â€“ it is perfectly acceptable to use a third-party (or built-in) library.
